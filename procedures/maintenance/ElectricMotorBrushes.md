# Brushed Motor Maintenance

Most electric motors have "brushes" that rub against another part called a commutator and slowly wear down.  They eventually need replacement which is standard maintenance and usually pretty easy to do.

In this example, we replace the brushes on an MP 29924 pump that circulates fluid through a hydronic heating system.

## Tools
- Philips-head Screwdriver
- 5/16" Wrench
- 3/8" Wrench
- 5/16" Socket
- Socket Spinner Handle
- 4" Socket Extension
- Small needle-node pliers or flathead screwdriver

##
1. Remove the pump and get it on the bench.  You can do this by removing hose clamps and disconnecting hoses but getting these connections completely re-sealed isn't always straight forward.  Instead, I prefer to take the pump head apart by removing the four 5/16" bolts.  Be careful not to loose the o-ring inside.

2. Remove the two 3/8" nuts on the pump head.

3. Remove the two philips-head screws at the back of the pump.  These are long screws that the nuts you just removed were attached to.

4. Remove the back of the pump where the two screws came out.  This may require some pryng but be careful not to damage the gasket or surfaces.  Keep track of the circular spring and nylon shim that will come with it.

5. Pull the housing off the pump while pushing the rubber gasket with wires off.  This is now only held on by the magnets, it will take some pulling but will slide off with some hand force.

6. Each of the two wires is connected to a brush that's held against the commutator by a spring.  These don't actually look like brushes but instead are rectangular black blocks.  Use small needle-nose or a flathead screwdriver to lift the springs up and lock out of the way allowing the brushes to slide out.

7. Many pumps use spade, screw terminal or other connectors for the wire to the brushes.  In my case, the brushes were hard-wired which required cutting and soldering the new brush connections.

8. Slide the new brushes into the holes where the old brushes came out and pop the springs back down so they're pressing the brush tight against the commutator.

9. Re-assmble and re-install the pump following steps 1-5 in reverse order.  When replacing the back of the pump, make sure the nylon shim goes into the plate before the circular spring.  It's helpful to lay the plate on your bench and place the pump over it to keep these and the gasket in place.
